## Introduction

VASP (Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package) is a popular computational tool for performing quantum mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It is widely used for electronic structure calculations and materials modeling at the atomic scale.

This guide aims to provide users with the knowledge needed to effectively use VASP, covering everything from installation to advanced topics.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Linux environment**: VASP is typically run on Unix-like systems.
- **Fortran compiler**: e.g., Intel Fortran Compiler.
- **MPI library**: e.g., OpenMPI for parallel computations.
- **BLAS/LAPACK**: Libraries for linear algebra operations.

### Installation Steps

1. **Download VASP**: Obtain the source code from the official VASP website (subscription required).
2. **Set environment variables**: Configure `VASP_HOME`, `VASP_SRC`, and `VASP_BIN`.
3. **Compile VASP**: Use the provided `makefile` with appropriate settings for your system.
4. **Test the installation**: Run test jobs to ensure the installation was successful.

## VASP Basics

VASP performs calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Understanding the basics is crucial:

- **Plane-wave basis set**: Used to describe the electronic wavefunctions.
- **Pseudopotentials**: Used to approximate the effect of core electrons on valence electrons.
- **Exchange-correlation functionals**: Approximations used to model electron-electron interactions.

## Input Files

VASP requires several key input files:

### POSCAR

- **Description**: Specifies the positions of atoms in the simulation cell.
- **Format**: Cartesian or direct coordinates.
- **Example**:
Si
5.431
0.0 0.5 0.5
0.5 0.0 0.5
0.5 0.5 0.0
Si
2
Direct
0.0 0.0 0.0
0.25 0.25 0.25

### POTCAR

- **Description**: Contains pseudopotentials for the elements in the system.
- **Source**: Must be generated from the appropriate directory of pseudopotentials.

### INCAR

- **Description**: The main control file that sets calculation parameters.
- **Key Parameters**:
- `ENCUT`: Energy cutoff for plane waves.
- `ISMEAR`: Smearing method.
- `SIGMA`: Width of the smearing in eV.
- `EDIFF`: Convergence criterion for electronic self-consistency.

### KPOINTS

- **Description**: Specifies the k-point sampling of the Brillouin zone.
- **Example**:
Automatic mesh
0
Monkhorst-Pack
4 4 4
0 0 0

## Running VASP

### Command

To run VASP, use the following command:

```bash
mpirun -np <number_of_processors> vasp_std
```
### Example Workflow
- Prepare the input files (POSCAR, POTCAR, INCAR, KPOINTS).
- Run VASP using the command above.
- Monitor the output in OUTCAR and OSZICAR.

### Common VASP Workflows
- Geometry Optimization
- Purpose: Optimize the atomic positions to minimize the total energy.
- INCAR settings:

`IBRION = 2`
`ISIF = 3`
`EDIFFG = -0.02`

### Band Structure Calculations
- Purpose: Calculate the electronic band structure of the material.
## Steps:
- Perform a self-consistent field (SCF) calculation.
- Use the resulting charge density for a non-SCF calculation.
- Density of States (DOS) Calculations
- Purpose: Calculate the density of electronic states.
- INCAR settings:

`ISMEAR = -5`
`NEDOS = 1000`

`ISMEAR = -5`
`NEDOS = 1000`

### Analyzing Results
- **OUTCAR**: Contains detailed information about the calculation.
- **CONTCAR**: Final atomic positions after a run.
- **DOSCAR**: Data for density of states.
- **EIGENVAL**: Eigenvalues for band structure calculations.

### Troubleshooting
- **Common Issues**
- **Convergence problems**: Adjust EDIFF, ENCUT, or use a different smearing method.
- **Errors in POTCAR**: Ensure the correct pseudopotentials are used.
